The first post. This website was made using Jekyll. I wanted to keep a blogsite for my coding experiences, but wanted to limit my spending to a minimum. Fortunately, GitHub supports Jekyll, and I was fortunate enough to find this before spending hours trying to build this on my own.

I used a [Jekyll Static Site Generator][youtube-playlist] tutorial playlist to get things started.

A few notes about Jekyll:

1) When you download Ruby, download it with the devkit so that you can update your Gem software properly. Gem is needed to download `Jekyll` and `bundle`, both of which are needed to get the blog started and the offline server running.

2) Watch through the whole playlist even if you don't need the info at the moment. I found the later videos very helpful for planning and understanding the program.
